🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

1\. Clone the Repository

git clone \[https://github.com/akshat1903kk/React-Minesweeper.git\](https://github.com/akshat1903kk/React-Minesweeper.git)

cd React-Minesweeper

2\. Install Dependencies

npm install

3\. Run the Development Server

npm run dev

The application will be available at http://localhost:5173.

🧩 Gameplay

Left Click: Reveal a cell.

Right Click: Flag or unflag a cell.

Goal: Reveal all non-mine cells without triggering a mine.

The status indicators (timer and flag counter) update dynamically in real-time.

💡 Core Concepts

Design Philosophy

The game embraces a soft gradient + glassmorphism aesthetic, focusing on minimalism and visual clarity. Typography uses Inter and Poppins for an elegant, modern look. Animations are tuned to be subtle yet expressive, making interactions smooth and engaging.

Development Notes

Modular Architecture: The project is organized into independent functional components (Board, Cell, GameStatusModal) for reusability.

Abstracted Logic: The core game logic is abstracted into the useMinesweeper.ts custom hook, making it easy to test, manage state, and scale.

Pure Tailwind: Styled entirely with TailwindCSS, ensuring no dependency on external CSS frameworks.

Animated Variants: Animations are modularized using Framer Motion variants for clean and readable component code.
